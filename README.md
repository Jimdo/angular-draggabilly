Angular Draggabilly directive - drag and drop for Angular
======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Jimdo/angular-draggabilly.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Jimdo/angular-draggabilly)
[![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/Jimdo/angular-draggabilly/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/Jimdo/angular-draggabilly#info=devDependencies)

This is an angular wrapper to [Draggabilly](https://github.com/desandro/draggabilly).

Does not create its own scope and does not pollute the parent scope.

And for all the ones that are curious about whether this one needs jquery-ui:
> look ma, no jQuery!

Usage
-----
* The simplest form (just a draggable element)
```html
<div draggabilly>Drag me</div>
```

### Dependencies
Angular Draggabilly needs the Draggabilly library and its dependencies.
* You can either install everything via bower (and if your package management resolves transitive packages you are good to go)
* or you can use the [packaged version of Draggabilly](http://draggabilly.desandro.com/draggabilly.pkgd.min.js) and the [dist version of Angular Draggabilly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jimdo/angular-draggabilly/master/dist/angular-draggabilly.min.js).
* or in the case of manual install, just add:
```javascript
'bower_components/classie/classie.js',
'bower_components/eventEmitter/EventEmitter.js',
'bower_components/eventie/eventie.js',
'bower_components/get-style-property/get-style-property.js',
'bower_components/get-size/get-size.js',
'bower_components/draggabilly/draggabilly.js',
'bower_components/angular-draggabilly/dist/angular-draggabilly.js'
```

### Options
* locking to axes
```html
<div draggabilly draggie-axis="y">Drag me vertically</div>
<div draggabilly draggie-axis="x">Drag me horizontally</div>
```
* containment in other elements
```html
<div id="container" style="width: 200px; height: 200px; background-color: red;">
	<div draggabilly draggie-containment="'#container'">x</div>
	<div draggabilly draggie-containment="true">o</div>
</div>
```
* snapping to grid
```html
<div draggabilly draggie-grid="[20, 20]">Snap me to a grid</div>
```
* dragging by handle
```html
<div draggabilly draggie-handle="#handle" style="background-color: blue; width: 100px; height: 100px;">
	<div id="handle" style="background-color: red; width: 20px; height: 20px; position: relative; left: 40px; top: 40px;"></div>
</div>
```

### Events
```javascript
var handler = function($event, instance, originalEvent, pointer) {
	console.log('The element', instance.element, 'is now at', instance.position.x, instance.position.y);
};
$rootScope.$on('draggie.start', handler);
$rootScope.$on('draggie.move', handler);
$rootScope.$on('draggie.end', handler);
```
By default, all events are emitted, however eventing can be disabled (and should be if not used, because it saves quite a few digest cycles) by adding `draggie-events=""` or selectively enabled by using `start`, `move` and `end`, e.g. `draggie-events="start,end"`.

Demo
----
You can start a demo server with `grunt demo` and go to [localhost:8000/demo](http://localhost:8000/demo/) to test the directive.

 * `grunt`: Execute tests and build dist
 * `grunt test`: Just test
 * `grunt test:e2e`: Just test end to end
 * `grunt test:unit`: Just test unit
 * `grunt tdd`: Watch source and test files and run tests
 * `grunt tdd:e2e`: Watch and test just end to end
